🚀 I just shipped 4 CLI productivity skills in 2 weeks — and they're all open source.

The problem: I was drowning in reminders, meetings, and scattered notes across Kindle, Audible, and podcasts.

The solution: 4 local-first CLI tools that automate the busywork:

📋 Smart Reminders Analyzer — Auto-categorizes 100+ reminders into Clear/Unclear/Obsolete

📅 Meeting Prep Assistant — Pulls calendar + emails, generates AI briefing before every meeting

🔄 Knowledge Sync — Kindle highlights → Readwise → Obsidian (automated weekly)

🎧 Podcast → Notes — YouTube/Podcast → Whisper transcription → AI summary → Obsidian

All built with local LLMs (MiniMax) and open source tools. No cloud subscriptions, no data leaks.

Proud to share these with the community. Check them out:

Hey r/productivity! 👋

I've been drowning in:
- 100+ reminders I never reviewed
- Meetings without context
- Kindle/Audible highlights scattered everywhere
- Podcasts I wanted to remember but forgot

So I built 4 local-first CLI skills that solve each problem:

## 🧙‍♂️ What I Built

### 1. Smart Reminders Analyzer
Analyzes all your Apple Reminders, categorizes them as:
- Clear (ready to do)
- Unclear (needs clarification)
- Obsolete (should delete)
- Duplicate (merge suggestion)

**Result:** Went from 114 → 80 reminders in first run.

### 2. Meeting Prep Assistant
2 hours before any meeting:
- Pulls calendar event
- Searches related emails (50ms SQLite)
- Generates AI briefing with attendees, context, talking points

**Result:** Never walk into a meeting unprepared again.

### 3. Knowledge Sync
Weekly automated sync of:
- Kindle highlights
- Audible notes
- → Organized Obsidian notes with templates

**Result:** All knowledge centralized, searchable, connected.

### 4. Podcast → Notes
Paste a YouTube or podcast URL:
1. Downloads audio
2. Transcribes with Whisper (local, free)
3. AI summary with key insights
4. Creates Obsidian note with tags

**Result:** Turn passive listening into active knowledge.

## 🔒 Why Local-First?

- No cloud subscriptions
- Your data stays on your machine
- Works offline
- No AI API costs after initial setup

## 📦 Get Started

All 4 skills are documented and ready to use:

🔗 github.com/Melflin/melflin-oss

Each skill has:
- Full README with examples
- Demo scripts
- Architecture diagrams
- Troubleshooting guide

Would love feedback from the community! What productivity tools are you building?

AMA about the implementation! 🧙‍♂️

Hi r/opensource! 👋

I just completed a 2-week sprint building 4 CLI productivity skills. They're all:
- Fully open source (MIT)
- Fully documented
- Local-first (no cloud dependencies)
- Tested and working

## The Skills

1. **smart-reminders-analyzer** — AI-powered reminder cleanup
2. **meeting-prep-assistant** — Automated meeting briefings
3. **knowledge-sync** — Kindle/Audible → Obsidian automation
4. **podcast-notes** — YouTube/Podcast → AI notes

## Architecture

Each skill follows the same pattern:
- `fetch.js` — Data retrieval
- `analyze.js` — AI processing
- `execute.js` — Action execution
- `index.js` — Unified CLI
- `README.md` — Full documentation

Built with:
- Node.js + MiniMax API (local-first AI)
- AppleScript (Reminders, Calendar)
- Whisper (local transcription)
- ffmpeg + yt-dlp (media handling)

## Why?

I wanted productivity tools that:
- Don't require monthly subscriptions
- Keep my data on my machine
- Work offline when needed
